4. LOCATION BASED MATCHING ENGINE

This rule must guide the entire system logic.

Buyer Matching Logic:

Buyers are matched to sellers based on location first.

Location filtering applies to all retail products.

If a buyer chooses wholesale or large quantities, override the location rule and show national level wholesalers.

Retail products should prioritize sellers within the same city.

If no city matches, show nearest sellers in surrounding areas.

Show shipping cost estimates on product cards when distance is high.

Implementation:

Each product must store location coordinates.

Each user must store location on signup.

API returns products sorted by closest seller.
